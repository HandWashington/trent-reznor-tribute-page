            <p>Just a reflection </p>
            <p>Just a glimpse </p>
            <p>Just a little reminder </p>
            <p>Of all the what abouts </p>
            <p>And all the might have </p>
            <p>Could have beens </p>
            <p>Another day </p>
            <p>Some other way </p>
            <p>But not another reason to continue </p>
            <p>And now you're one of us </p>
            <p>The wretched</p>
            <p>The hopes and prays </p>
            <p>The better days </p>
            <p>The far aways </p>
            <p>Forget it</p>
            <p>It didn't turn out the way you wanted it to </p>
            <p>It didn't turn out the way you wanted it to, did it? </p>
            <p>It didn't turn out the way you wanted it to </p>
            <p>It didn't turn out the way you wanted it to, did it?</p>
            <p>Now you know </p>
            <p>This is what it feels like </p>
            <p>Now you know </p>
            <p>This is what it feels like </p>
            <p>The clouds will part and the sky cracks open </p>
            <p>And god himself will reach his fucking arm through </p>
            <p>Just to push you down </p>
            <p>Just to hold you down </p>
            <p>Stuck in this hole with the shit and the piss </p>
            <p>And it's hard to believe it could come down to this</p>
            <p>Back at the beginning </p>
            <p>Sinking </p>
            <p>Spinning</p>
            <p>And in the end </p>
            <p>We still pretend </p>
            <p>The time we spend </p>
            <p>Not knowing when </p>
            <p>You're finally free </p>
            <p>And you could be </p>
            <p>But it didn't turn out the way you wanted it to </p>
            <p>It didn't turn out quite the way that you wanted it</p>
            <p>Now you know </p>
            <p>This is what it feels like </p>
            <p>Now you know </p>
            <p>This is what it feels like</p>
            <p>You can try to stop it but it keeps on coming </p>
            <p>You can try to stop it but</p>
